Here are a few thing I've spotted:

Threads:
Doesn't show anything (I had to post something to get to show content)

New & others:
The number of comments aren't showing like the original?
(Fixed)

Past:
If I click on "month" I get APRIL as a date, but it shows me the last 8 days
(Correct)

Comments:
Is empty
(Fixed)

Submit:
Submitting a URL gives an error and doesn't post anything - however submitting a normal post works
(Fixed)

Comments on a post:
- If they are nested (replies to other comments) they don't seem to show
- Commenting on a comment and then clicking on "Parent" gives an error

Favorite:
Doesn't seem to be working?

Delete:
It says "You canâ€™t delete that item." even if it's my item
(Fixed)

On a post:
- Clicking on "past" gives an error "An error occurred."
- The upvote feature isn't showing (it's not showing on the other pages either)
